# PyQt6-QtPdf-Viewer

Visualization of a PDF and change of the current page using QtPdf and QtPdfWidgets.
It is an alternative to the visualization with WebEngine, in which I haven't found a way of changing the visualized page from code.

Right now, 2023/08, it is hard to find an example online that uses QtPdf in PyQt6. For this reason, I shared this script.

# Instructions

Change the constants `PDF_PATH` and `PDF_STARTING_PAGE`, then you can run the script.

# Requirements

Tested with

- Windows 10
- Python 3.10.12
- PyQt6 6.5.2
